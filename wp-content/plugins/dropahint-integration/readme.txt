The Hint Receiver, via personal e-mail, gets a beautifully styled Hint Card, that is a live-link to the exact product the browsing visitor "hinted". Drop a Hint App allows for up to four cards to be carried at any given time. Your visitors will be able to choose from 4 cards, styled by you. Our app features the option - "Capture Item" Hint Cards. Essentially cards, that will capture and display the exact item being hinted together with the graphic design you created for your Hint Card.
